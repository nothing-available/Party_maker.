# House Party

Django React Application with Spotify API

1. User can authenticate our application to access their data with a certain scope

2. After the user has logged in and granted authorization we obtain access/refresh tokens

3. User access token is used to make requests to the Spotify API

4. After one's access token has expired, we request a new one using the refresh token (stays constant) to continue interacting with the Spotify API
